Description
------------
Package ni488 is a wrapper around the NI-488.2 GPIB driver: it allows an
application to communicate with GPIB enabled test equipment. NI-488.2 is an industry
standard for GPIB communications.

The Windows installer includes both 32 and 64 bit drivers, as well as, two versions
of the header file, 2001 and 2007. On OSX the driver is 32 bit only and the 2001
version of the header file must be used. I've done nothing on Linux yet. :-(


Usage
-----
See example.go

Compiling
---------
To build the ni488 package with the 2007 header file: $ make install
To build the ni488 package with the 2001 header file: $ make v2001=1 install

To build the example: $ 8g example.go ; 8l -o example example.8 ; ./example

Misc Notes
----------

--- OSX info ---
Method 1: Startup key combination (for current startup only)

If your Mac uses the 32-bit kernel by default, but supports the 64-bit kernel, you 
can start up using the 64-bit kernel by holding the 6 and 4 keys during startup.

If your Mac uses the 64-bit kernel by default, you can start up with the 32-bit 
kernel by holding the 3 and 2 keys during startup. Your Mac will revert to the 
default kernel the next time you reboot it.
 

Method 2: On-disk setting (persistent)

To select the 64-bit kernel for the current startup disk, use the following command in Terminal:

sudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture x86_64

To select the 32-bit kernel for the current startup disk, use the following command in Terminal:

sudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture i386

Note: This setting is stored in the /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist 
file and will take effect every time you start up from this disk. If you start up from a different 
disk, the setting on that disk, or the hardware default, will take effect.
