Package ni488 wraps National Instruments NI488.2 General Purpose Interface Bus
(GPIB) driver. The driver allows a client application to communicate with a GPIB
enabled piece of test equipment remotely and/or programmatically. NI-488.2 is an
industry standard for GPIB communications.

Some GPIB types of test equipment:
Digital Multimeter
Power Supplies
Universal Radio Communications Testers
Signal Generators
Spectrum Analyzers
Thermal Chambers
Network Analyzers
Oscilloscopes

Drivers:

    - Windows  On 32-bit platforms, the DLL's (gpib-32.dll or ni4882.dll)
      are compiled against ni488.h and 64-bit platforms against ni4882.h.

    - OSX  32-bit library only and compiled against ni488.h. 

    - Linux  Nothing on Linux yet. :-(

     Caveats

Only tested against the 32-bit driver so far.

   Compiling
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Set cgo's LDFLAGS-top of ni488.go/ni.386.go/ni.amd64.go-for your environment. 

Note that cgo doesn't currently handle Windows paths so you'll need to copy 
the NI DLL (gpib-32.dll or ni4882.dll) into the package's build directory, then
set "-L./" in LDFLAGS. See the CL here http://codereview.appspot.com/5154042/ 
  
To build the package: $ make install
To build the example: $ 8g example.go ; 8l -o example example.8 ; ./example

  My Misc Notes

9-30-2011: 
Windows: when compiling on 32-bit platforms AllSpoll is undefined. 


--- OSX info ---
Method 1: Startup key combination (for current startup only)

If your Mac uses the 32-bit kernel by default, but supports the 64-bit kernel, you 
can start up using the 64-bit kernel by holding the 6 and 4 keys during startup.

If your Mac uses the 64-bit kernel by default, you can start up with the 32-bit 
kernel by holding the 3 and 2 keys during startup. Your Mac will revert to the 
default kernel the next time you reboot it.
 

Method 2: On-disk setting (persistent)

To select the 64-bit kernel for the current startup disk, use the following command in Terminal:

sudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture x86_64

To select the 32-bit kernel for the current startup disk, use the following command in Terminal:

sudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture i386

Note: This setting is stored in the /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist 
file and will take effect every time you start up from this disk. If you start up from a different 
disk, the setting on that disk, or the hardware default, will take effect.
