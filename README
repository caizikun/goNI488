Package ni488 is a wrapper around the NI-488.2 GPIB driver: it allows an
application to communicate with GPIB enabled test equipment. NI-488.2 is an
industry standard for GPIB communications.

    against ni4882.h.

    OSX - 32-bit library compiled against ni488.h. 

    Linux - Nothing on Linux yet. :-(

My Misc Notes

9-30-2011: 
Windows: 32-bit compiling, AllSpoll is undefined when linking against either
ni4882.dll & gpib-32.dll. 


--- OSX info ---
Method 1: Startup key combination (for current startup only)

If your Mac uses the 32-bit kernel by default, but supports the 64-bit kernel, you 
can start up using the 64-bit kernel by holding the 6 and 4 keys during startup.

If your Mac uses the 64-bit kernel by default, you can start up with the 32-bit 
kernel by holding the 3 and 2 keys during startup. Your Mac will revert to the 
default kernel the next time you reboot it.
 

Method 2: On-disk setting (persistent)

To select the 64-bit kernel for the current startup disk, use the following command in Terminal:

sudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture x86_64

To select the 32-bit kernel for the current startup disk, use the following command in Terminal:

sudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture i386

Note: This setting is stored in the /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist 
file and will take effect every time you start up from this disk. If you start up from a different 
disk, the setting on that disk, or the hardware default, will take effect.
